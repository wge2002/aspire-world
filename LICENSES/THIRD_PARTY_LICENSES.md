# Third-Party Licenses

ASPIRE contains, modifies, or integrates the third-party material listed below.
The project-level [Apache License 2.0](../LICENSE) does not replace any
component-specific terms. Exact revisions are recorded whenever this repository
pins or modifies a particular upstream version.

This catalog focuses on material present in the parent source tree, dependency
patches, pinned Git submodules, and external components with material license
constraints. Python packages installed separately are declared in
`aspire/sim/pyproject.toml` and `aspire/real/pyproject.toml`; their own license
files and package metadata apply. This is not a transitive software bill of
materials.

## Pinned Git submodules

The parent repository records only gitlinks. A recursive clone obtains these
repositories from their configured remotes, and their own terms govern their
source, models, datasets, and assets.

| No. | Component | Local path | Configured source and exact pin | License | Parent-artifact / recursive-checkout status |
| ---: | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | LIBERO-PRO | `aspire/sim/cap/third_party/LIBERO-PRO` | [`uynitsuj/LIBERO-PRO@47aaa8038930bcdc84ab9ea2867e2ffc8039ab4a`](https://github.com/uynitsuj/LIBERO-PRO/tree/47aaa8038930bcdc84ab9ea2867e2ffc8039ab4a) | Code MIT; upstream README describes datasets as CC BY 4.0 | Parent stores a gitlink only. Recursive checkout fetches datasets and object assets; coverage of all included assets remains for OSRB review. |
| 2 | Robosuite (YAM fork) | `aspire/sim/cap/third_party/robosuite` | [`uynitsuj/robosuite@97292732ed909ac3ae116579fb768607034a4dbd`](https://github.com/uynitsuj/robosuite/tree/97292732ed909ac3ae116579fb768607034a4dbd) | MIT, with DeepMind MuJoCo Apache-2.0 attribution | Parent stores a gitlink only. Recursive checkout fetches extensive YAM and other robot assets whose provenance remains for OSRB review. |
| 3 | Robosuite (LIBERO dependency) | `aspire/sim/cap/third_party/libero_dependencies/robosuite` | [`Max-Fu/robosuite@a498b087d4bc5a3981e3d27030d09bc537a537f3`](https://github.com/Max-Fu/robosuite/tree/a498b087d4bc5a3981e3d27030d09bc537a537f3) | MIT, with DeepMind MuJoCo Apache-2.0 attribution | Parent stores a gitlink only. Recursive checkout fetches robot and arena assets whose provenance remains for OSRB review. |
| 4 | SAM 3 | `aspire/sim/cap/third_party/sam3` | [`facebookresearch/sam3@6fe87d64a5beb9084923d7a9e002741178635b09`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam3/tree/6fe87d64a5beb9084923d7a9e002741178635b09) | Custom SAM License covering redistribution, acknowledgment, trade controls, and prohibited uses | Parent stores a gitlink only. The recursive pin contains source and sample/evaluation media but no tracked model weights; custom-license approval is required. |
| 5 | cuRobo | `aspire/sim/cap/third_party/curobo` | [`NVlabs/curobo@d64c4b005459db10c5dd867d8b30a87d5bda9bdb`](https://github.com/NVlabs/curobo/tree/d64c4b005459db10c5dd867d8b30a87d5bda9bdb) | Custom NVIDIA license, plus [`LICENSE_ASSETS`](https://github.com/NVlabs/curobo/blob/d64c4b005459db10c5dd867d8b30a87d5bda9bdb/LICENSE_ASSETS) | Parent stores a gitlink only. Recursive checkout fetches robot/scene assets; public-recipient use is limited to noncommercial research or evaluation. |
| 6 | BEHAVIOR-1K bundle (`b1k`) | `aspire/sim/cap/third_party/b1k` | [`qingh097/b1k@272ec5ca9936453c4a8fd335c4dfba61245e33ca`](https://github.com/qingh097/b1k/tree/272ec5ca9936453c4a8fd335c4dfba61245e33ca) | Mixed MIT, Apache-2.0, and asset-specific terms | Parent stores a gitlink only. The recursive pin contains Pixar HumanFemale USD assets that prohibit redistribution without written authorization; recursive redistribution is blocked pending OSRB/Legal confirmation. |
| 7 | Contact-GraspNet PyTorch | `aspire/sim/cap/third_party/contact_graspnet_pytorch` | [`elchun/contact_graspnet_pytorch@2d71da4e50a04aa353352d1cae99f20f7022145b`](https://github.com/elchun/contact_graspnet_pytorch/tree/2d71da4e50a04aa353352d1cae99f20f7022145b) | Custom NVIDIA Contact-GraspNet license; bundled PointNet code is MIT | Parent stores a gitlink and the three-hunk compatibility patch only. Recursive checkout fetches source, the tested checkpoint, test data, and media from upstream. |

The parent ASPIRE source artifact stores gitlinks only and does not include
populated submodule contents. Recursive checkout fetches those repositories
separately under their own terms. The complete populated-tree inventory,
license hashes, nested-repository findings, Git LFS results, and approval gates
are in [`SUBMODULE_AUDIT.md`](evidence/SUBMODULE_AUDIT.md) and
[`SUBMODULE_AUDIT.tsv`](evidence/SUBMODULE_AUDIT.tsv).

## External runtime components

These components are not redistributed in the parent repository. Users obtain
them separately, and their vendor or upstream terms apply.

| Component | Distribution status | Terms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BundleSDF / BundleTrack | Source, checkpoints, and runtime payload are intentionally excluded | No approved redistribution grant has been established for the recovered source snapshot; review the [recovery record](../aspire/real/install/locks/bundlesdf/README.md) before use or distribution. |
| AnyGrasp SDK, server, and checkpoint | Vendor source, demo-derived server code, model, credentials, and machine license are intentionally excluded; ASPIRE retains only its client protocol and external-service launcher | Vendor terms apply. The separately installed `graspnetAPI` package is MIT, but that license does not cover the AnyGrasp SDK, demo, server, or model. |
| Stereolabs ZED SDK and `pyzed` | Downloaded from Stereolabs during workstation setup | Proprietary [Stereolabs Software and Services License Agreement](https://www.stereolabs.com/legal) applies. |
| Stereolabs ZED 2i reference CAD | Not redistributed. ASPIRE uses an NVIDIA-authored box proxy with the same axis-aligned bounds in its station models. | The detailed vendor CAD is available from the [official Stereolabs 3D-model page](https://www.stereolabs.com/3dmodels); Stereolabs terms apply to that separately obtained material. |
| SAM 2.1 model assets | Downloaded separately from Hugging Face | Apache-2.0; see the [official model repository](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam2.1-hiera-large). |
| SAM 3 model assets | Downloaded separately from a gated Hugging Face repository | The custom SAM License and gated-access conditions apply; see the [official model repository](https://huggingface.co/facebook/sam3). |

## Resolved NVIDIA YAM CAD

`base_visual_gate.stl`, `gripper.stl`, and `gripper_finger.stl` are
NVIDIA-owned assets developed internally by the team. `gripper_finger.stl` was
exported from the NVIDIA-owned Fello gripper. They are distributed under this
project's Apache-2.0 license and NVIDIA copyright notice. See the adjacent
[station-assets notice](../aspire/real/robot/models/station/assets/README.md).

The source-file ownership boundary and exact CaP-X/NVIDIA path mapping are
recorded in [`SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md`](evidence/SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md) and the
accompanying [`SOURCE_PROVENANCE.tsv`](evidence/SOURCE_PROVENANCE.tsv).
