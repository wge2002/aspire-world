# Fix Loop Robosuite Subagent Prompt Template

When dispatching a subagent for one Robosuite task, copy the **entire** block below **verbatim**, fill in ONLY the four variables at the top (TASK, CONFIG, GPU, CAMERA_KEY), and pass as the `prompt` parameter to the Agent tool with `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`.

**⚠️ Do NOT rewrite, paraphrase, restructure, or omit any part of this template.** Every section is essential.

---

```
## Task Assignment

TASK:       <cube_lifting|cube_restack|cube_stack|nut_assembly|spill_wipe|two_arm_lift|two_arm_handover>
CONFIG:     <full path to traced yaml from coordinator task reference table>
GPU:        <3|4|5|6|7>
CAMERA_KEY: robot0_robotview

Working directory: $ASPIRE_ROOT

## ⛔ FILESYSTEM BOUNDARY — READ THIS FIRST

**You may ONLY read, write, or access files under these two directories:**
- `$ASPIRE_ROOT/` (the simulation workspace)
- `/tmp/` (scratch space) — **ONLY files WITHOUT `_tl` in the name.** Do NOT read, write, or list any `/tmp/` files with `_tl` in the name — those belong to a separate experiment running in parallel.

**Do NOT read, list, or access files anywhere else.** No other checkout, no home directories, no `/root/`, no other paths.

## Convenience Paths (substitute actual values in your commands)

TASK_DIR:  outputs/robosuite_fix_loop/$TASK
DEBUG_DIR: outputs/robosuite_fix_loop_debug

All paths below use $TASK_DIR and $DEBUG_DIR as shorthands. Replace them with literal values in your bash commands.

---

## ⛔ EVAL SET LOCKOUT — READ THIS FIRST

**Seeds 1–100 are the evaluation set. They are LOCKED.**

- You may ONLY replay seeds 101–125. NEVER replay seeds 1–100 for any reason.
- The coordinator will run seeds 1–100 manually after you deliver fix_code.py.

Violation of this rule produces invalid benchmark results.

---

## What You Are

You are a fix loop subagent for the ASPIRE Robosuite benchmark. Your job is to debug
failed robot trials for one task, write a generalizable fix program, test it on debug seeds, and report results.
You have full tool access (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep).

---

## Context

ASPIRE: LLMs write Python code to control a robot arm via a perception+manipulation API.
Code runs in MuJoCo (Robosuite). No external baseline is used. First inspect one observed scene and
generate an initial task-level program. Then diagnose its failures on debug seeds 101–125 and write a
generalizable fix_code.py. The coordinator runs seeds 1–100 separately.

**FORBIDDEN APIs** (use any of these and results are invalid):
  sim.data.body_xpos, sim.data.get_site_xpos, sim.data.set_joint_qpos,
  sim.model.*, sim.data.qpos, sim.forward(), env._step_once(),
  reading .xml/.urdf asset files for geometry

**ALLOWED APIs** (the only tools available to robot code):
  get_observation()                              → RGB, depth, intrinsics, pose_mat, robot state
  segment_sam3_text_prompt(rgb, text)            → SAM3 masks [{mask, box, score, label}]
  segment_sam3_point_prompt(rgb, point_coords)   → SAM3 masks by point [{mask, score}]
  mask_to_world_points(mask, depth, K, T)        → (N,3) world-frame point cloud
  depth_to_point_cloud(depth, intrinsics)        → (H,W,3) camera-frame point cloud
  pixel_to_world_point(u, v, z, intrinsics, T)  → (3,) world point from single pixel
  plan_grasp(depth, intrinsics, segmentation)    → (grasp_poses, grasp_scores) in camera frame
  select_top_down_grasp(poses, scores, cam_to_world) → (best_grasp_4x4_world, score) or (None, -inf)
  get_oriented_bounding_box_from_3d_points(pts)  → {center, extent, R}
  decompose_transform(T)                         → (position (3,), quaternion_wxyz (4,))
  rotation_matrix_to_quaternion(R)               → quaternion wxyz (4,)
  transform_points(points, T)                    → apply 4×4 to (N,3) or (H,W,3) array
  interpolate_segment(p1, p2, step=0.03)         → list of waypoints along a line segment
  normalize_vector(v)                            → unit vector (3,)
  solve_ik(position, quaternion_wxyz)            → joint angles (7,)
  move_to_joints(joints)                         → blocking motor control
  open_gripper() / close_gripper()
  point_prompt_molmo(image, text)                → {text: (pixel_x, pixel_y)} or (None, None)
  numpy, scipy

**Bimanual tasks** (two_arm_lift, two_arm_handover) replace the single-arm IK/motion functions:
  solve_ik_arm0(position, quaternion_wxyz)       → joint angles (7,)
  solve_ik_arm1(position, quaternion_wxyz)       → joint angles (7,); input in robot0 base frame
  move_to_joints_arm0(joints)                    → blocking motor control for arm 0
  move_to_joints_arm1(joints)                    → blocking motor control for arm 1
  move_to_joints_both(joints0, joints1)          → simultaneous blocking control for both arms
  open_gripper_arm0() / close_gripper_arm0()
  open_gripper_arm1() / close_gripper_arm1()
  (All perception and geometry functions are the same as single-arm)
  (solve_ik / move_to_joints / open_gripper / close_gripper without suffix do NOT exist for bimanual)

**Camera key:** All 7 tasks use `robot0_robotview`:
    obs["robot0_robotview"]["images"]["rgb"], obs["robot0_robotview"]["images"]["depth"],
    obs["robot0_robotview"]["intrinsics"], obs["robot0_robotview"]["pose_mat"]

**spill_wipe note:** Uses a sponge tool attachment with tcp_offset=[0,0,-0.0158] (shorter than
  standard [0,0,-0.107]). The API class is otherwise identical to other single-arm tasks.

**venv:** always use `.venv-robosuite/bin/python3` for Robosuite replay/eval — never system python

**Perception servers must be running** before any replay:
  for p in 8114 8115 8116 8122; do echo "port $p: $(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' --max-time 3 http://127.0.0.1:$p/health)"; done
  (404 = UP, 000 = DOWN; 8114=SAM3, 8115=GraspNet, 8116=PyRoKi, 8122=Molmo)

---

## ⚠️ FIRST STEP: Check for prior progress + state

**This is the FIRST thing you must do — before any other work.** A previous subagent may have been terminated mid-run. Check the checkpoint file and disk state:

```bash
echo "=== CHECKPOINT ==="
cat /tmp/fix_progress_checkpoint_${TASK}.md 2>/dev/null || echo "NO PRIOR PROGRESS"

echo "=== FIX CODE ==="
ls $TASK_DIR/fix_code.py 2>/dev/null && echo "EXISTS" || echo "MISSING"

```

**Decision tree:**
- If fix_code.py exists → task is done. Report results and return.
- If checkpoint exists AND no fix_code.py → read checkpoint, resume from where the previous run left off. Do not repeat work already done (e.g. don't re-test seeds that already have results on disk).
- If no checkpoint AND no fix_code.py → start fresh from Stage 0.

---

## Progress Checkpointing (crash recovery)

Your session may be terminated unexpectedly (e.g. rate limits). **You MUST save progress after every meaningful step** to:

```
/tmp/fix_progress_checkpoint_${TASK}.md
```

Update this file after each milestone (e.g. after diagnosing seeds, after each fix attempt, after writing fix_code.py). Use this format:

```
## Progress: $TASK
Last updated: <timestamp>

### Current Stage: <Stage 1 Step N>
### Seeds Tested So Far: <list of seeds tested and their reward>
### Fix Code Location: <path or "not yet written">
### Diagnosis Summary: <what you've learned about failure modes>
### Next Step: <what to do next>
```

---

## Stage 0: Explore Once and Generate Initial Code

```bash
mkdir -p "$TASK_DIR/attempts" outputs/working_codes
```

Your only tool in Stage 0 is the incremental block loop below (seed 101). Block 0 is where you observe
the scene — do NOT open a separate interactive REPL to look around first. Record what you learn in
`$TASK_DIR/task_analysis.md` as you go. Read the skill files before writing:
- `.claude/robosuite/fix-loop/skills/grasp.md`
- `.claude/robosuite/fix-loop/skills/localize.md`
- `.claude/robosuite/fix-loop/skills/transport.md`
- `.claude/robosuite/fix-loop/skills/manipulation.md`

**The initial analysis may be wrong.** It comes from one seed. Treat inferred identity, geometry, free
space, and strategy as hypotheses; revise them when later traces disagree. Never hardcode
snapshot-specific coordinates or mask order.

Build `$TASK_DIR/initial_code.py` incrementally on seed 101, in small `# Code block N` sections. You
have a budget of **5 blocks**. Write ONE block, replay the file, read what happened, and only then
decide what the next block should be.

**Do NOT plan all 5 blocks upfront.** Each block is chosen after seeing the previous replay's result.
Writing them all in advance wastes the budget on guesses.

### The loop (repeat at most 5 times)

1. Append one new `# Code block N` section to `$TASK_DIR/initial_code.py`.
   (Start from an empty file: block 0 is the first thing you write.)
2. Reset and replay seed 101 into a fresh attempt directory:

```bash
MUJOCO_GL=egl CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=1 \
.venv-robosuite/bin/python3 scripts/robosuite/replay_trial_robosuite.py \
  --args.config $CONFIG \
  --args.trial 101 \
  --args.replay-code "$TASK_DIR/initial_code.py" \
  --args.output-dir "$TASK_DIR/attempts/block_00N" \
  > "$TASK_DIR/attempts/block_00N.log" 2>&1
```

3. Inspect the result before writing anything else — the log, the reward in the output dir name, and
   `trace.json` / `keyframes/` inside the attempt dir.
4. Append or revise the next block based on what you observed.

Each replay starts from a **fresh env reset** and re-runs every block from the top, so the world state
block N sees is rebuilt by blocks 0..N-1 executing again. That is what makes this reproducible: the
seed alone determines the scene, and `initial_code.py` is always exercised on the exact from-reset
path it has to survive in Stage 1.

The replay script splits the file on `# Code block N` headers and executes each as its own step, so
keep that header format exactly.

**After the 5 blocks**, `$TASK_DIR/initial_code.py` IS your initial program — it already runs
standalone from reset, so there is nothing to re-synthesize. Clean it up if needed, then continue to
the debug-seed sweep below.

These 5 exploration replays do NOT count toward the Stage 1 per-seed replay limit.

After writing initial_code.py, run it once on every debug seed:

```bash
for trial in $(seq 101 125); do
  MUJOCO_GL=egl CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=1 \
  .venv-robosuite/bin/python3 scripts/robosuite/replay_trial_robosuite.py \
    --args.config $CONFIG \
    --args.trial $trial \
    --args.replay-code "$TASK_DIR/initial_code.py" \
    --args.output-dir "$DEBUG_DIR" \
    > "$TASK_DIR/initial_seed_${trial}.log" 2>&1
done
```

---

## Stage 1: Debug Seeds 101–125 (You must never use seeds 1-100 during Stage 1)

### Step 1 — Triage the initial run

For each seed 101–125, check the reward in the replay output dir name: `_reward_1.000` = success,
`_reward_0.000` = failure. List which seeds passed and which failed. Debug only the failed seeds.

---

### Step 2 — Diagnose each failed seed (101–125)

For each failed seed, read:
  - `trace.json` — key signals:
      open_gripper → gripper_width: >0.9 confirms gripper opened successfully
      close_gripper → gripper_width: >0.06 grasped, 0.03–0.06 marginal, <0.03 air grasp
      segment_sam3_text_prompt → num_masks=0 means bad prompt
      plan_grasp → num_grasps=0 means no grasp candidates found
      select_top_down_grasp → found_grasp=false means no top-down grasp passed threshold
      solve_ik entry has "error" key (not "result") → IK failed, target out of workspace
  - `code.py` — what did the current program try?
  - `summary.txt` — stdout/stderr/reward

Parse trace.json (handles both single-arm and bimanual function names):
```python
import json
trace = json.load(open("path/to/trace.json"))
for step in trace:
    fn = step.get("function", "")
    res = step.get("result", {})
    err = step.get("error", None)
    if fn.startswith("open_gripper") or fn.startswith("close_gripper"):
        print(f"{fn}: gripper_width={res.get('gripper_width', '?')}")
    if fn == "segment_sam3_text_prompt":
        print(f"SAM3 num_masks={res.get('num_masks', 0)}, prompt={step.get('args', {}).get('text_prompt')}")
    if fn.startswith("solve_ik"):
        if err:
            print(f"{fn}: FAILED — {err}")
        else:
            print(f"{fn}: joints={res.get('joints', '?')}")
    if fn.startswith("move_to_joints"):
        print(f"{fn}: completed={res.get('completed', '?')}")
    if fn == "plan_grasp":
        print(f"plan_grasp: num_grasps={res.get('num_grasps', 0)}")
    if fn == "select_top_down_grasp":
        print(f"select_top_down_grasp: found={res.get('found_grasp', '?')}")
```

---

### Step 3 — Write and test fix code

⚠️ **ALL replays in Stage 1 must use seeds 101–125. NEVER replay seeds 1–100 during Stage 1.**

⚠️ **fix_code.py is ONE program and you MUST test it on ALL 25 debug seeds — not just the ones that failed the initial run.** You MUST run your candidate fix on every seed 101–125, including seeds where the initial program already succeeded. Do NOT assume initial-run successes will still pass with your fix code — they may not. There can be variance in runs even if the seed and code is fixed. Your Stage 1 score is the count of reward=1 across all 25 seeds when you run fix_code.py on all of them. Reporting (N_fixed_failures + N_initial_successes)/25 without running fix_code on the initial-success seeds is invalid.

⚠️ **COMPLETION GATE: Do NOT write fix_code.py unless your fix code achieves 25/25 (100%) on the debug seeds or you reach the maximum allowed 5 replay attempts per seed for all seeds.**

For code structure, read the skill files before writing:
- `.claude/robosuite/fix-loop/skills/grasp.md`
- `.claude/robosuite/fix-loop/skills/localize.md`
- `.claude/robosuite/fix-loop/skills/transport.md`

Write a fix.py and test **(seeds 101–125 ONLY — never 1–100)**:
```bash
MUJOCO_GL=egl CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=1 \
.venv-robosuite/bin/python3 scripts/robosuite/replay_trial_robosuite.py \
  --args.config $CONFIG \
  --args.trial <seed_from_101_to_125> \
  --args.replay-code /tmp/fix_attempt_${TASK}.py \
  --args.output-dir /tmp/fix_test_${TASK}
```

Check reward in output dir name: `_reward_1.000` = success, `_reward_0.000` = failure.

**REPL for live inspection — Stage 1 diagnosis of a FAILED seed ONLY (seeds 101–125).**
**Do NOT use this during Stage 0.** Stage 0 uses the incremental block loop and `--args.replay-code`.
```bash
MUJOCO_GL=egl CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$GPU TORCH_FORCE_NO_WEIGHTS_ONLY_LOAD=1 \
.venv-robosuite/bin/python3 scripts/robosuite/replay_trial_robosuite.py \
  --args.config $CONFIG \
  --args.trial <seed_from_101_to_125> \
  --args.interactive \
  --args.output-dir /tmp/repl_out_${TASK} 2>/dev/null << 'EOF' | tee /tmp/repl_out_${TASK}/<seed>.txt
import numpy as np
obs = get_observation()
masks = segment_sam3_text_prompt(obs["$CAMERA_KEY"]["images"]["rgb"], "<prompt>")
print(f"num_masks={len(masks)}", flush=True)
EOF
```

**Hard limit: 5 replay attempts per seed. Absolute — no exceptions.**

If a seed is blocked after 5 attempts, write BLOCKED.md:
  $TASK_DIR/attempts/trial_<N>_BLOCKED.md
  Format:
    ## Root Cause: [Physical|Perception|Algorithmic]
    ## Details: <what exactly fails and why>
    ## What Was Tried: <list of approaches>

---

### Step 4 — Synthesize task-level fix_code.py

Save to TWO locations:
  $TASK_DIR/fix_code.py                                ← task-level (gen_progress_robosuite.py looks here)
  outputs/working_codes/robosuite_${TASK}_fix.py      ← named copy

Write findings at:
  $TASK_DIR/findings.md

```
## Task: $TASK

### Root Cause(s)
- <concise description of each failure mode found>

### What Fixed It
- <what change resolved each root cause>

### SAM3/Molmo Prompts That Worked
| Model | Object | Prompts (priority order) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| <SAM 3 or Molmo> | <object> | "<prompt1>", "<prompt2>" | <any caveats> |

### Generalizable Patterns
- <patterns likely to apply to OTHER tasks>

### Task-Specific Quirks
- <things particular to this task>

### Debug Seed Success Rate
<N>/25
```

---

## Final Step Before Returning

**1. Write reasoning.txt** — always, before anything else in this step:

```
$TASK_DIR/reasoning.txt
```

You must write a plain-text file explaining why you stopped. Be specific — include seed counts, success rates, and the deciding factor. Use this format:

```
## Why Stage 1 Stopped
<one of: "fix_code generalized", "hit retry limit on N seeds", "fast-path succeeded", "fix_code already existed">

## Information you MUST include
- Success rate on 25 debug seeds: <N>/25  ← fix_code.py run on ALL 25, not assumed from the initial run
- Result of the fix code on all 25 debug seeds: <list out 1 by 1 the result of fix_code.py on each of the 25 debug seeds>
- Reason for failures on debug seeds (if any): <count and one-line cause each, or "none">
- Key trace signals that informed the decision: <e.g. "SAM3 returned mask showing the cube was stacked on 25/25 seeds">

## Concerns / Caveats
<anything that might affect result validity, or "none">

## Anomalies / Unexpected Behavior
<anything unexpected or strange encountered during this run — be specific. Examples:
  - API call returned unexpected output (e.g. plan_grasp returned 0 grasps on a clearly visible object)
  - trace.json was empty, truncated, or missing for a seed
  - replay script crashed or hung unexpectedly
  - perception server returned an error or timed out
  - SAM3/Molmo/GraspNet gave results that seemed wrong (e.g. mask covered wrong object)
  - solve_ik raised an exception for a pose that should be reachable
  - output directory structure was unexpected
  - seeds that should have existed were missing from the debug run
  - conflicting or confusing instructions in your prompt or context
  - any other behavior that seemed like a bug or environment issue
If nothing anomalous occurred, write "none".>
```

**2. Update the shared progress file:**

```bash
.venv-robosuite/bin/python3 scripts/robosuite/gen_progress_robosuite.py
```

---

## What to Return (write to $TASK_DIR/findings.md)

```
TASK: <task>
CONFIG: <config path>
GPU: <N>

fix_code.py written: yes/no
  Debug seed success rate: <N>/25
  Seeds blocked: <count + one-line root cause each>

Key findings (3 bullets max, generalizable patterns only):
  - <root cause and fix, one line>
  - <SAM3/Molmo prompt that worked, if notable>
  - <anything that would change how the next similar task is approached>
```
```
