# run-baseline-robosuite

How to run a full traced multimodel baseline across all 7 Robosuite tasks.

---

## Overview

The batch runner iterates over config_paths × models × seeds, writes artifacts to `./outputs/<run_name>/`, and prints per-task results. Tasks run sequentially; workers run trials concurrently within each task.

Every trial records `trace.json` and `keyframes/` via the Traced API classes (required for the fix loop).

**Robosuite tasks (7 total):**
- `cube_lifting` — pick up the red cube and lift it
- `cube_restack` — place red cube on top of green cube
- `cube_stack` — place red cube on top of green cube (different layout)
- `nut_assembly` — insert brown square nut onto brown square block
- `spill_wipe` — wipe the brown spill (sponge attached to gripper)
- `two_arm_lift` — bimanual: both arms lift a pot by its handles
- `two_arm_handover` — bimanual: arm 0 picks up hammer, hands to arm 1

**Seeds:** convention is seeds 101–125 (25 trials) for baselines, seeds 1–100 for eval.

## Prerequisites

1. **Env**: `.venv-robosuite` exists and can run `aspire.sim.cap` scripts.
2. **Inference credentials**: load the proxy credentials from an approved secret manager into the environment variables used below.
3. **Ports**: this baseline script launches local proxies:
   - codegen proxy on `:8110`
   - VDM proxy on `:8111`
4. **Perception servers**: SAM3 `:8114`, GraspNet `:8115`, and PyRoKi `:8116` are running in a persistent tmux session. SAM3 requires Hugging Face authentication; GraspNet requires the pinned Contact-GraspNet submodule, its compatibility patch, and `--extra contactgraspnet` in the perception environment. The common startup script verifies and applies the patch before starting any service.

## Launch command

```bash
: "${CODEGEN_KEY_FILE:?Set CODEGEN_KEY_FILE to a protected key file}"
: "${VDM_KEY_FILE:?Set VDM_KEY_FILE to a protected key file}"

scripts/robosuite/run_baseline_robosuite.sh
```

Each key file contains one API key per line. The same protected file may be
used for both variables when one provider account serves both workloads.

The script defaults to the NVIDIA inference endpoint. For another
OpenAI-compatible provider, set `CODEGEN_BASE_URL` and optionally
`VDM_BASE_URL`. If that provider exposes different names for the same paper
models, provide an alias object inherited by both local proxies:

```bash
export CODEGEN_BASE_URL=https://provider.example/v1/
export VDM_BASE_URL="$CODEGEN_BASE_URL"
export ASPIRE_MODEL_ALIASES_JSON='{
  "openai/openai/gpt-5.4": "gpt-5.4",
  "aws/anthropic/bedrock-claude-opus-4-6": "claude-opus-4-6"
}'
```

**What the script does:**
- Start two local proxies (`aspire.sim.cap.serving.openrouter_server`) for key rotation.
- Run `cap/envs/scripts/run_robosuite_batch.py` for all 7 tasks with the flat `env_configs/robosuite/` traced configs.
- Use `--args.total-trials 125` and baseline convention seeds 101–125 (`resume_idx: 101` in each config).
- Write logs under `logs/` and outputs under `outputs/`.

## Output structure

```
outputs/
  baseline_robosuite_multimodel_ensemble_traced/
    ensemble_multimodel/
      ensemble_multimodel/
        <config_stem>/
          trial_101_sandboxrc_0_reward_.../
            code.py
            trace.json
            keyframes/
            video_*.mp4
```

**Success counting:**
```bash
ls outputs/baseline_robosuite_multimodel_ensemble_traced/ensemble_multimodel/ensemble_multimodel/<config_stem>/ \
  | grep "taskcompleted_1" | wc -l
```

---

## Monitoring

```bash
tail -f logs/robosuite_baseline.log | grep --line-buffered -E "Batch execution|Running Experiment|FAILED|ERROR"
```

---

## Timing

- Failing trials run to `max_steps` (default 100 steps for Robosuite ≈ 2–4 min/trial)
- With 5 workers: 25 trials / 5 workers = 5 rounds ≈ 10–20 min/task
- 7 tasks total ≈ 1–2 hours for all tasks
