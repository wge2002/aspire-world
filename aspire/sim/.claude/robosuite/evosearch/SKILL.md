# Robosuite Fix Loop + Evolutionary Search

Start with [INSTRUCTIONS.md](INSTRUCTIONS.md).

## Run Order

1. Confirm the traced config exists and the Fix Loop has produced
   `outputs/robosuite_fix_loop/<task>/fix_code.py` for each target.
2. Complete the coordinator preflight and wait for explicit launch approval.
3. Follow [main-agent-prompt.md](main-agent-prompt.md).
4. Fill [subagent-prompt.md](subagent-prompt.md) once per confirmed task.
5. Seed `candidate_A` verbatim from the task's Fix Loop `fix_code.py`.
6. Search on seeds 101-125 only, then evaluate the selected code on seeds 1-100.
